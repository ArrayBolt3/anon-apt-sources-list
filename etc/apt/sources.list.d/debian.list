# This is a default sources.list for Anonymity Linux Distributions,
# which are derivatives of Debian.

# If you want to see the example, which came with the upstream
# distribution, see: /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list

# Instead of directly editing this file,
# the user is advised to create the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/user.list.
# This is because when this package gets updated,
# /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list will be overwritten and may receive new
# new default values and comments. The entire folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
# gets scanned for additional sources.list files by apt-get.
# The user may keep their settings even after updating this package.
##
# Without graphical user interface, you can use for example:
#    sudo editor /etc/apt/sources.list.d/user.list
# With graphical user interface (KDE), you can use for example:
#    gksudo xdg-open /etc/apt/sources.list.d/user.list

# - Why is buster-updates disabled by default?
#   See: https://wiki.debian.org/StableUpdates
# - Why are sources (deb-src) disabled by default?
#   Because those are not required by most users, to save time while
#   running "sudo apt-get update".
