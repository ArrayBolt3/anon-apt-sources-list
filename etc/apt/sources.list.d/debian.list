## This is a default sources.list for Anonymity Linux Distributions,
## which are derivatives of Debian.

## If you want to see the example, which came with the upstream
## distribution, see: /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list

## Instead of directly editing this file,
## the user is advised to create the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/user.list.
## This is because when this package gets updated,
## /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list will be overwritten and may receive new
## new default values and comments. The entire folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
## gets scanned for additional sources.list files by apt-get.
## The user may keep their settings even after updating this package.
##
## Without graphical user interface, you can use for example:
##    sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/user.list
## With graphical user interface (KDE), you can use for example:
##    kdesudo kwrite /etc/apt/sources.list.d/user.list

## Technical notes:
## - Why is stretch-updates disabled by default?
##   See: http://wiki.debian.org/StableUpdates
## - Why are sources (deb-src) disabled by default?
##   Because those are not required by most users, to save time while
##   running "sudo apt-get update".
